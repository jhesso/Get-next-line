# Get-next-line
The second project in Hive Helsinki

The goal of this function is to return the "next line" from a given file descriptor.
(the first time it's called, the next line will be actually the first line)

The only difference between the mandatory and the bonus is that the bonus can handle multiple file descriptors at the same time

This has been added to my libft project after completion.
